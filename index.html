<div align="center"><h2><font color="red">Flame suit, French leather and my girl bad<br>
Gatekeeper say it's open, I ain't come back<br>
Fifty minutes TED talk, collecting forty racks<br>
One milli' paid in tax, bitch, do the math<br>
Do the math<br>
Bitch, do the math<br>
One milli' paid in tax, bitch, do the math<br>
Do the math<br>
Bitch, do the math<br>

Huh, did the math<br>
I'm baby Johnny Cash<br>
My girl gon' throw it back<br>
Damn, my life a Cinemax<br>
Holy hell, this smacks<br>
I make hits and you make trash<br>
I'm on vacay, do not ask<br>
Poolside eating Apple Jacks<br>
Shut up, bitch (Shut up)<br>
Big deal like T.J. Maxx (Maxx)<br>
Bought some cataracts<br>
Watching Art Attack (Woah)<br>
Nick Cage, how I act<br>
Heavily dislike tax<br>
Got some Asics on my feet<br>
Never wear Air Max<br><br>

I'm in the cut like a wound<br>
Wake your ass up, makе some room<br>
And my girl coming soon<br>
I don't fuck with honeymoons<br>
Throw some monеy on my tomb<br>
Finesse too hard, I'm feeling OOM<br>
Girls love me, they want to spoon<br>
Let me finish, I'll resume<br><br>


Flame suit, French leather and my girl bad<br>
Gatekeeper say it's open, I ain't come back<br>
Fifty minutes TED talk, collecting fourty racks<br>
One milli' paid in tax, bitch, do the math<br>
Do the math<br>
Bitch, do the math
One milli' paid in tax, bitch, do the math<br>

I just curved Cameo<br>
She said I'm her Romeo (Juliet)<br>
She gon’ split me up and lick me up like Oreo<br>
First global book deal, sell that shit to Indigo<br>
Getting money since I was an itty-bitty embryo<br>
Save my money but I die for the fam<br>
Always make it sail, catamaran<br>
Shawty tryna play some games but I don't play Catan<br>
I'm a plug, she an outlet<br>
Cut out Mr. Middleman<br><br>

Yeah<br>
I've got assets she wants to come see, yeah<br>
Only speak the truth, hyperbole (Facts)<br>
God damn, I sound good on this beat (Sheesh)<br>
Extraterrestrial, E.T.​<br><br>
